    "## 1.0 - Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set [Laser Diode](../../datasheets/[Box%20Electronics%20Laser%20Datasheet]%201550nm%2020mW%20PM%20Fiber%20Coupled%20Laser.pdf) current to 80mA (Ilim should be 100mA). This is done trhough setting LD I in the [Laser Diode Controller](../../datasheets/[SRS%20LDC%20Datasheet]%20LDC500c.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Set attenuator to max attenuation, connect laser to attenuator in and attenuator out to [Lightwave Converter](../../datasheets/[Photodetector%20Datasheet]%20Agilent%2011982A%20Amplified%20Lightwave%20Converter%20.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Connect EOM and FP cavity between attenuator and PD if not already connected\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Turn on TEC, then turn on laser\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Run 1V sinusoid at ~800Hz from RP to mod port on LDC\n",
    "\n",
    "6. De-attenuate until max voltage observed on O-scope is around 400-445mV. Should NOT go over 450. \n",
    "\n",
    "7. Note the FP-cavity appears to have a side-mode and high driver frequencies on the mod-port e.g. ~2kHz+ do not reliably generate the traversal pattern. It is believed that this is due to the limited bandwidth on the LDC modport. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Connect PD output to pitaya RF in, should be the same signal as what is feeding the O-scope i.e. use a splitter. Run the RP Oscilloscope application. For futher info on using the Red Pitaya, refer to the [RP Guide](../../general/rp_guide.md) document."
